I have created this model using BackgroundSubtractorMOG.Invloves the use of python,opencv,tensorflow,tensorflow object detection API.
It is easy to build using given libraries than using CNN(as it involves lesser to built)
It could have been created using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) too.
The model is tested on the all the videos that were provided and it is working fine for the all coorindinates that the user given inputs.
